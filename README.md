# About code
GRAPHICS_MODE - this is mean, compile code which out game objects in console.

Any bots have "brain", array of commands (numbers)
Command "1" can mean move left. Command "2" move right.
So, commands can be with arguments. Command "5" have one argument. This argument mean side where the bot spawn a new bot.

List of commands:
1 - move left
2 - move right
3 - move down
4 - move up

6 - kill(side)
7 - get food from light.
8 - goto(pointer)
