# Bot-Evolition

This is small project for Orange PI. I want to run it on a few days, or weeks. Maybe in future i add neural networks.

# About code
GRAPHICS_MODE - this is mean, compile code which out game objects in console.

## Local projects. (ForPC & OrangeEvolition)
You can run ForPC on your computer, but if you have Raspberry pi or others, you can run OrangeEvolition.
I create project ForPC, for fast debugging.
