# Bot-Evolition

This is small project for Orange PI. I want to run it on a few days, or weeks. Maybe in future i add neural networks.

My code bad? I don't know. If yes, i will happy is you try to help me.

# About code
GRAPHICS_MODE - this is mean, compile code which out game objects in console.

## Local projects. (ForPC & OrangeEvolition)
You can run ForPC on your computer, but if you have Raspberry pi or others, you can run OrangeEvolition.
I create project ForPC, for fast debugging.


# Logic of bot
Any bots have "brain", array of commands (numbers)
Command "1" can mean move left. Command "2" move right.
So, commands can be with arguments. Command "5" have one argument. This argument mean side where the bot spawn a new bot.

I plan add a many command, and command "goto" which will change bot brain counter. Maybe i add command "if". This command can made behaivor of bots very hard to understanding, behaivor will become better.
